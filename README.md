Each one leads for a  different feature in our app. and we will come to those features later.
If you choose (Add a color to your room) you will have another page in which you can select either multiple images of your room (if you couldn't take a whole picture) or your full room image, then you will select the area you wants to color, then show it.

## Inspiration and future work
This app was inspired by one of our team members who has gone through hard times with his apartment, spent a lot of time imagining his room and thinking what it will be like, he spent a lot of money and hard work moving and removing his furniture to see what's better.
### future work
1- we will add some more features to our app, like allowing the user to rotate his furniture to best fit his room.
2- we will show his room as 360 degree so the user can deel like it's real and give him a better view.

We used Python 3.7, opencv v2.4 for coding, (Pycharm IDE) for building, debugging and testing.

##Inspiration and future work
This app was inspired by one of our team members who has gone through hard times with his apartment, spent a lot of time imagining his room and thinking what it will be like, he spent a lot of money and hard work moving and removing his furniture to see what's better.
###future work
1- we will add some more features to our app, like allowing the user to rotate his furniture to best fit his room.
2- we will show his room as 360 degree so the user can deel like it's real and give him a better view.
